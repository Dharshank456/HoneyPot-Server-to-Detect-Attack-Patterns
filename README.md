# HoneyPot-Server-to-Detect-Attack-Patterns
Deploy a honeypot using Cowrie or custom scripts to simulate vulnerable SSH/FTP services. Log attacker connections, commands, and IPs. Analyze repeated attempts, block threats with fail2ban, and visualize attacker geolocations. Ideal for VM deployment and threat detection.

# Cowrie Honeypot Configuration
My cowrie honeypot runs openly on the internet via a virtual machine in the cloud. This approach will eliminate the need to expose my personal network to attackers and safely monitor and study the tactics of threat actors.
